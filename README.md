## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Single Cluster (Recommended for Learning)
```bash
# See docs/01-getting-started/first-deployment.md for full guide
cd foundation
./scripts/create-dawn-cluster.sh
./scripts/deploy-dawn.sh
```

### Option 2: Infrastructure as Code with Pulumi
```bash
# See docs/02-infrastructure-as-code/pulumi-setup.md for full guide
cd foundation/infrastructure/pulumi
pulumi up
```

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- ✅ **Kubernetes Fundamentals** - Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, HPA
- ✅ **AWS EKS** - Managed Kubernetes on AWS
- ✅ **Infrastructure as Code** - Pulumi for declarative infrastructure
- ✅ **Application Management** - Managing K8s apps with code (not YAML)
- ✅ **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions for automated deployments

## 📖 Key Concepts Explored

### Kubernetes Deep Dives
- [Deployment Hierarchy](docs/05-kubernetes-deep-dives/deployment-hierarchy.md) - How Deployments → ReplicaSets → Pods
- [ConfigMap Relationships](docs/05-kubernetes-deep-dives/configmap-relationships.md) - Managing configuration
- [Rolling Updates](docs/05-kubernetes-deep-dives/rolling-updates.md) - Zero-downtime deployments

### Infrastructure as Code
- [Two-Tier Architecture](docs/02-infrastructure-as-code/two-tier-architecture.md) - What to manage where
- [Application as Code](docs/03-application-management/application-as-code.md) - Python instead of YAML

## 🛠️ Interactive Scripts

Explore Kubernetes concepts hands-on:
```bash
foundation/scripts/explore/explore-deployment-hierarchy.sh      # Visualize Deployment → Pod relationship
foundation/scripts/explore/explore-configmap-relationships.sh   # See ConfigMap to Pod connections
foundation/scripts/explore/explore-rolling-updates.sh           # Watch rolling updates in action
```

## 📦 What's Included
